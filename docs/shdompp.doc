                for Plane-Parallel Atmospheric Radiative Transfer



                        OVERVIEW

SHDOMPP computes unpolarized radiative transfer in a plane-parallel
medium for either collimated solar and/or thermal emission sources of
radiation.   Currently Lambertian and RPV land surface BRDF surface
reflection are supported.  The atmosphere optical properties are
specified with an input file listing the layer interface heights and
temperatures, and layer optical depth, single scattering albedo, and
Legendre series coefficients of the phase function.  Two output files
are generated: one with the upwelling and downwelling hemispheric fluxes
and actinic fluxes at the layer boundaries and another with radiances at
specified heights and directions.  The SHDOMPP calculation may be either
monochromatic or spectrally integrated with a k-distribution.

The SOLVE_SHDOMPP subroutine in shdompp.f90 is designed to be simple to
call in user programs, and its inputs and outputs are documented in the
code.  SHDOMPP is written in Fortran 90.



            SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES FROM SHDOM

The algorithm is based on that of SHDOM, having iterations between
calculating the source function in spherical harmonics and integrating
the radiative transfer equation in discrete ordinates.  A major
difference from SHDOM is that the medium is represented by layers which
have uniform optical properties, like DISORT, rather than linear
interpolation of the optical properties between grid points.  Another
difference from SHDOM is that the source function is interpolated within
each layer by a cubic polynomial (quadratic at the layer boundaries). 
This gives higher accuracy in the source function integration, allowing
fewer points (levels) to be used for the same accuracy.  Like SHDOM, an
adaptive grid is used, but the criterion for deciding to split sublayers
is different.  The current SHDOMPP cell splitting criterion is the rms
radiance difference between using the cubic/quadratic and linear source
function interpolation in the RTE integration.  Thus it is a measure of
how much the curvature of the source function affects the radiances. The
splitting criterion is normalized, so it is a relative measure, whereas
the criterion in SHDOM is an absolute measure.   Unlike in SHDOM the
spherical harmonic series of the source function is not adaptive.  The
delta-M method is always turned on internally, and is not a user
specified parameter.  SHDOMPP is written completely in Fortran 90 and
exists in one file, while SHDOM is mainly Fortran 77.


                     INPUT PARAMETERS

The parameters are input in the routine USER_INPUT.  USER_INPUT uses
READ statements from stdin in response to written messages.  The
USER_INPUT routine echos the input values so that a useful "log" file
output is produced when run non-interactively (see scripts).

                  The solution criterion is the rms change in the source

There are also three parameters set in the code at the top of shdompp.f90:
 MAXDELTAU=1.0         maximum layer optical depth allowed in initial sublayers
 SPLITTING_FACTOR=10.0 max number of internal grid points is this factor
                         times the number of input layers + optical depth
              (We have to guess the maximum array size for the adaptive grid.)
 PRNT=.TRUE.           true for interation printing, false for no printing

There is a parameter set at the top of the SOLVE_SHDOMPP subroutine:
  MINDELTAUSPLIT=1.0E-3  minimum scaled optical depth for which an input
                           layer is divided into two sublayers or 
                           adaptively split



                       PROPERTY FILE FORMAT

The medium optical properties are specified for uniform layers from the
top of the atmosphere down to the surface.  The file is plain ascii and
read by Fortran free format (so most "lines" may be broken across
lines).  The property file has a header of two lines followed by one
line for each layer:
      Nlay
      Ztoa  Ttoa
      Zbot  Tbot  tau  ssalb  Nleg  Chi1 Chi2 ...
        . . .
 "Nlay" is the number of layers.  "Ztoa" is the height and "Ttoa" is the
temperature (K) of the top boundary of the first layer.  "Zbot" is the
height and "Tbot" is the temperature (K) of the bottom boundary of the 
layer.  "tau" is the layer optical thickness (not the cumulative optical
depth), and "ssalb" is the single scattering albedo of the layer. 
"Nleg" is the order of the Legendre series for the phase function, i.e.
it is the number of Legendre coefficients that follow.  "Chi?" are the
Legendre series phase function coefficients, starting with l=1 (so that
Chi1 is 3 times the asymmetry parameter).  The heights must decrease,
but can have any units, except they must match the k-distribution file
(usually units of km) when input.

For solar reflection problems the whole Legendre phase function series
is used to calculate output radiances using the Nakajima and Tanaka
(1988) TMS method.  Therefore, the full Legendre series (until ChiN<<1)
should be input.


                  USING A K-DISTRIBUTION

Spectral integration across a wavenumber band may be performed using a
k-distribution.  If the CKDFILE input is NONE then a monochromatic
calculation is performed, otherwise the CKDFILE contains the molecular
absorption coefficients of the k-distribution for a particular 
atmospheric profile.  The format of the CKD file is the same as that for
SHDOM.  SHDOMPP loops over the k-distribution calling the monochromatic
solver (SOLVE_SHDOMPP) once for each k.  For each k the molecular
absorption profile is integrated over each layer in the input property
file (assuming linear interpolation between the levels in the CKD file),
and added to the optical properties specified in the property file.


                      ACCURACY ISSUES

The accuracy of SHDOMPP output radiances and fluxes is determined by the
angular resolution, chosen by NMU and NPHI, the spatial resolution,
chosen by SPLITACC (and the input property file and the MAXDELTAU
parameter), and the solution convergence, chosen by SOLACC.  By contrast
the accuracy of DISORT is determined solely by the number of streams
(NMU).  A good choice for solar reflection problems is NPHI=2*NMU, but
for high Sun or low viewing zenith angles or a more isotropic phase
function a smaller NPHI could be accurate.  For thermal emission
problems set NPHI=1.  Note: NPHI is the number of azimuth angles in 0 to
2*pi, but only the range 0 to pi is actually used internally.   There is
seldom any point in having the SPLITACC and SOLACC parameters set very
small if the accuracy is limited by low angular resolution (small NMU). 
How the actual accuracy depends on the input parameters should be
investigated with a convergence test for problems similiar to the ones
you want to carry out.  See the "run_compare_shdompp" script for
examples of convergence testing.  See "compare_shdompp_disort.txt" for
the accuracy and timing results comparing SHDOMPP and DISORT for a
variety of atmospheric radiative transfer problems.  



                 RUNNING SHDOMPP

First compile shdompp.f90, and the other programs in the distribution if
desired.  Edit the makefile to specify your Fortran 90 compiler and
flags.  The distribution contains two scripts to illustrate how to run
SHDOMPP:
  run_shdompp_examples   five radiative transfer examples, including a
                            k-distribution test.
  run_compare_shdompp    extensive accuracy and timing comparison of
                            SHDOMPP and DISORTSH for monochromatic RT.




              OTHER PROGRAMS in DISTRIBUTION


DISORTSH

disortsh.f90 is a driver program for DISORT version 2.1, which is
available via anonymous ftp from 
   ftp://climate.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/wiscombe/Multiple_Scatt/DISORT2.0beta
(note: the directory and file names tend to change).  The relevant
Fortran files of the DISORT distribution are provided in the file
"disort2.f".  Although disortsh is written in Fortran 90 and
automatically allocates the appropriate array sizes, there are array
sizes internal to DISORT that may need to be changed.  In disort2.f look
for "LOCAL SYMBOLIC DIMENSIONS" and change MXCLY, MXULV, MXCMU, MXUMU,
and MXPHI as needed.  Note: there is a dramatic increase in running time
if these array sizes are much larger than needed for the particular
problem.  See DISORT.doc for description of the DISORT routine and
parameters.

DISORTSH reads the same optical property files as SHDOMPP.  Its user
inputs read from stdin are also similiar to those of SHDOMPP, and its
output file format is also similiar.  Run disortsh interactively, or
look at the scripts or the USER_INPUT subroutine to see the required
input parmeters.



PPMIEPRP

ppmieprp.f90 makes optical properties files for SHDOMPP and DISORTSH
using Mie table files output by cloudprp or make_mie_table (in the SHDOM 
distribution). The integrated mass content (e.g. liquid water path) and 
effective radius for each of several particle components are specified 
for each layer.  Molecular Rayleigh scattering is included with a Rayleigh
scattering coefficient [K/(km mb)] that depends on wavelength.  The
pressure at the layer boundaries, from which the integrated air density
is calculated, are computed by the program from the input height and
temperature profile.  A molecular absorption for each layer is also
specified; these must be computed with another program such as MODTRAN.

Rayleigh scattering coefficient:  The molecular scattering coefficient
depends on the air density.  Hence for a particular solar wavelength 
band a coefficient (k) may be defined which gives the extinction from
the air pressure (p) and temperature (T):  ext = k p/T.  The Rayleigh
scattering coefficient input may be derived from the molecular Rayleigh
scattering optical depth.  The Rayleigh optical depth at sea level as a
function of wavelength (lambda in micron) is
    tau = 0.0088*lambda**(-4.15+0.2*lambda)
From this formula the cloudprp Rayleigh input coefficient is
    k = (2.97E-4 K mb^-1 km^-1) lambda**(-4.15+0.2*lambda)
